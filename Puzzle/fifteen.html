      American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely
      credited with creating the puzzle; indeed, Loyd claimed from 1891 until
      his death in 1911 that he invented it. The puzzle was actually created
      around 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York.
