1. In jQuery terminology, what is the difference between the “jQuery function” and the “jQuery object”? 

Ans: 



jQuery is a java script library. The dollar sign with the parentheses is the shorter name of the jQuery function.This is the function that creates jQuery objects and

registers handlers to be invoked when the DOM is ready; it also serves as the jQuery namespace.

I usually refer to it as $()



Jquery object is an object that represent a set of document elements. It can also be called a Jquery result or Jquery set.

 Jquery object is returned by Jquery function.  A Jquery object contain length, context and selector properties.



 

2. Write jQuery code to find all h1 elements that are children of a div element and make their background

color red.



Sample HTML:

<body>

<h1>abc</h1><br><div>

 <h1>div-1</h1>

 <h1>div-2</h1>

 </div>

 <h1>xyz</h1>

</body>



Ans:   $("div").children("h1").css({ color: "red" });





3. Use a jQuery method to insert the text "YES!" at the end of the <p> element.

Ans: $("p").append("YES");
